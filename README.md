## Overview

This is the main marketing and product ordering page for a fictional company who specialise in building custom surfboards
based in Cornwall, UK. The site will be responsive and accessible on all devices, however, primarily the site will be aimed
at desktop users due to the form process for placing an order being much easier to complete on this device. The site will be
easy to navigate, enjoyable to use, and contain all the information needed regardless of the prior knowledge the user has.

## UX
### User Stories
- First Time Visitor Goals

    a. As a first time visitor, I want to gain understanding of the purpose of the site and the intentions of the
    business. Including explanative information in case of not having a strong understanding of the product.

    b. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily find the product information that I visited the site for.
    Also have an enjoyable experience aesthetically and find using the websites features simple.
            
    c. As a first time visitor, I want to look for previous products created to ensure that using this company is the
    right decision, I would expect to find these not only through social media links but also a gallery page. Also
            providing customer testimonials would enhance this.

- Returning Visitor Goals

    a. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to easily order a product custom to my specifications in a
    reasonably quick manor.

    b. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to find alternative ways to contact the company other than the order
    form. This is in case of needing to alter my order, or to request an update.

    c. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to find out further information about the company and brand. This
    included new products, design and background history.

- Frequent Visitor Goals

    a. As a frequent visitor, I want to easily be able to sign up to a newsletter so that I always find out about 
    upcoming changes/information via email.

    b. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to create an account so that my order history and details are easily 
    accessed for use in future orders.

    c. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to find further social media links to be able to follow on 
    multiple platforms.

## User Centered Design
### Strategy Plane

- The initial goal of the site is for users to find out more about the company through general informative text sections,
and imagery that fits the rest of the sites aesthetics.

- The most important goal of the site is for users to place an order for a surfboard manufactured to their exact requirements.

- This site is mainly aimed at users who already partake in surfing as a hobby and have the required skill to warrent needing 
this type of high end product. Regardless of this there will be enough information to aid users who perhaps don't have as much
prior knowledge.

### Scope Plane | Trade Off

- The current features that are in the design plan and of the highest priority are;

    - Responsive navigation bar.

    - Hero image with a button placed strategically to direct the user to the most important page.

    - Following [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) grid system with the layout of the site
    being mainly in thirds.

    - Footer containing links to social media platforms.

    - A form page that contains radio buttons, drop down lists and text inputs.

- The features that are of a lower priority that may not be including in this build of the site are;

    - Closeable modal window that prompts the user to sign up for the newsletter.

    - Map included on site providing the exact location of the business.

    - A more generlised contact form option.

    - Navigation bar changing to a clickable burger icon on smaller screen sizes.

    - Navigation links enlarging when hovered over with the users cursor.

### Structure Plane

- This site will be structured using lots of imagery and short informative paragraphs. 

- The layout will mainly be in thirds or in half on larger screen sizes to not overload the user visually 
and to keep the functionality at optimum.

- In order to direct the user to the most important areas of the website buttons and imagery for these
will be contained with the hero image that will be seen first.

- To ensure the users experience when completing the form for ordering is smooth, this page will contain
minimal information and imagery to not distract the user.

### Skeleton Plane

#### Wireframes

- [Website desktop view](wireframes/ltsc-desktop.pdf)

- [Website tablet view](wireframes/ltsc-tablet.pdf)

- [Website mobile view](wireframes/ltsc-mobile.pdf)

## Design
### Colour Scheme

- The main colours used will be monochrome and very simplistic, using ivory, charcoal and black.

- Reasoning behind these choices are that they add a sense of luxury to the brand and don't pull the attention 
away from the imagery and purpose of the site.

### Typography

- There will be two similar font types used throughout the website. The 'Comfortaa' font for the headings 
with a Sans Serif fallback font if for any reason the font isn't imported correctly or a certain browser doesn't support it. 
The font primarily used for paragraph text will be 'Inconsolata' with the same fallback font of  Sans Serif.
            
 - 'Comfortaa' is a clean, stylish, and aesthetically pleasing font that will tie in well with the styling of the rest of
the website. This font works well for headings therefore creating consistency without effecting the sites style.

- 'Inconsolata' is not to dissimilar from 'Comfortaa' so again it creates consistency, however, there is enough of a difference
that it breaks up text sections and overall makes the website easy to read and aesthetically pleasing.

### Imagery

- The imagery will be very important on the website, I plan to use images to convey information about the company and
products. The first thing visitors will see when the site loads will be a large jumbotron image with a call to action 
button included. The reason for this is to immediately direct the user to the key order form page.

- I also plan to use imagery on the modal that prompts visitors to sign up to the newsletter.

- The about page titled 'Our Story' will use imagery to tell a story about the business. 
Primarily this will inform the visitor about what the business creates featuring previous products, as well as, showing the design process.

- There will also be icon imagery included in the site, however, this will be minimal in order to still keep the aesthetic style
consistent.

- The imagery used will be de-saturated in colour and the main focal will be on the products and lifestyle based around these. 
The de-saturation in colour will fit in with the rest of the simple monochrome colours used throughout the rest of the website.

### Logo

- The logo for site was created using the same Sans Serif style font through an online application called 
[Hatchful](https://hatchful.shopify.com/). It follows the same greyscale color that the rest of the site is styled in 
and was designed in a clean, and simple way that aesthetically works well but also follows visual hierarchy.

## Technologies Used

### Syntax

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs 

1. [Hatchful](https://hatchful.shopify.com/)
     - Hatchful was used to generate the logo, which was then edited to my specifics within their website.

2. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - The Balsamiq application was used to create wireframes for each website page on various device screen
    sizes.

3. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Used to display icons on the landing page and the social media icons in the footer.

4. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - Bootstrap was widely used throughout the site for responsiveness using the grid system, displaying or hiding elements, the navigation bar,
    and the form on the order page.

5. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Used to import the two fonts used throughout the site Comfortaa and Inconsolata.

6. [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - To add a size increase to specific text links when the users cursor hovers over them.

7. [Github](https://github.com/)
    - Used to host the entire repository for the project.

8. [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
    - This was the platform used to build the entire project on.
    
9. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
    - Used to host the live version of the website as well as integral to aid in the de-bugging of the project.

10. [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
    - A tool to check how the website appears and the functionality on various devices. The image at the top of this document was generated from this website.

11. [jQuery](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) 
    - The Bootstrap version 4.5 used for this project requires jQuery for certain elements, in my project this was needed for the collapsible navigation bar.

### Resources

1. [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
    - The majority of the imagery on the site was collected from here. Unsplash provide high resolution
    images free to use on the internet.

2. [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/)
    - The only other website used for imagery, the images displayed on the about/our story page were collected from here. 

3. [Web Designer Depot](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2012/10/creating-a-modal-window-with-html5-and-css3/)
    - I used this example on how to create a pop-up modal window only using HTML and CSS to design my own to use for my project. The changes that I made to the original example are; 
    Adding it into my navigation bar as a clickable link, adding a form section into the modal window itself, and changing the styling to fit the aesthetics of my website.

4. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - Stack Overflow was used to research various programming techniques as well as problem solving a few issues and bugs encountered. One of the main techniques that was used on
    my project found on Stack Overflow was making the font size of links increase in size smoothly and this was found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47960948/link-grow-font-on-hover).

5. [Can Adapt](http://www.davidmacd.com/blog/alternate-text-for-css-background-images.html)
    - Since I was using background images throughout my project I was unsure on the correct way to add alternative text to these for screen readers. I found all the information needed
    on the Can Adapt site who specialise in web accessibility training.

6. [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)
    - This educational website contains lots of useful information for programming, I primarily used it to select slightly lighter tones for my colour scheme.

7. [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
    - Similar to other resources used CSS tricks provided small amounts of general knowledge to help with the CSS for this project.

8. [W3C Validator HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) & [W3C Validator CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
    - Both of these were used to test all the code for the project whilst working and for the finished website to check for valid HTML and CSS.

9. [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
    - This was used to add vendor prefixes to the CSS used in the project to increase cross browser compatibility.

10. [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)
    - This application was used to test the functionality and appearance of the project on all main browsers.

## Testing

### Syntax Testing

Continually throughout the project I would test my code through both W3C validators to ensure everything was correct before moving on. Once the project was completed everything was ran 
through once more to check, all code has passed with no errors as seen in below.

### User Story Testing

#### First Time Visitor Goals Testing

- *"As a first time visitor, I want to gain understanding of the purpose of the site and the intentions of the
business. Including explanative information in case of not having a strong understanding of the product."*

    - By using a logo that contains the word 'Surf' straight away gives the user an idea of what the company are involved in. The first image used
    with the call to action button placed over the top with the header below 'Handcrafted Surfboards on the North Coast of Cornwall' has now informed the user
    exactly what this companies purpose is. 

    - For the user to find out more in depth information about the business they only have to scroll down to the first section on the landing page where the 'Why Us' section
    will tell them everything about the company and brand.

- *"As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily find the product information that I visited the site for.
Also have an enjoyable experience aesthetically and find using the websites features simple."*
    
    - Product information can be easily found on the landing page in the 'Why Us' and the 'Surfers Stories' testimonial sections. Further product information can be found on the 'Our Story'
    page easily found in the navigation bar.

    - The website has been kept simple and clean with good aesthetics, clear imagery, good flow, minimal colours and other possible distractions avoided such as overuse of icons and other elements.
