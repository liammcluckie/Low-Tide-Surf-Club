<!--Add images of site on devices here-->

<!--Add live link project here-->

## Overview

This is the main marketing and product ordering page for a fictional company who specialise in building custom surfboards
based in Cornwall, UK. The site will be responsive and accessible on all devices, however, primarily the site will be aimed
at desktop users due to the form process for placing an order being much easier to complete on this device. The site will be
easy to navigate, enjoyable to use, and contain all the information needed regardless of the prior knowledge the user has.

## UX
### User Stories
- First Time Visitor Goals

    a. As a first time visitor, I want to gain understanding of the purpose of the site and the intentions of the
    business. Including explanative information in case of not having a strong understanding of the product.

    b. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily find the product information that I visited the site for.
    Also have an enjoyable experience aesthetically and find using the websites features simple.
            
    c. As a first time visitor, I want to look for previous products created to ensure that using this company is the
    right decision, I would expect to find these not only through social media links but also a gallery page. Also
            providing customer testimonials would enhance this.

- Returning Visitor Goals

    a. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to easily order a product custom to my specifications in a
    reasonably quick manor.

    b. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to find alternative ways to contact the company other than the order
    form. This is in case of needing to alter my order, or to request an update.

    c. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to find out further information about the company and brand. This
    included new products, design and background history.

- Frequent Visitor Goals

    a. As a frequent visitor, I want to easily be able to sign up to a newsletter so that I always find out about 
    upcoming changes/information via email.

    b. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to create an account so that my order history and details are easily 
    accessed for use in future orders.

    c. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to find further social media links to be able to follow on 
    multiple platforms.

## User Centered Design
### Strategy Plane

- The initial goal of the site is for users to find out more about the company through general informative text sections,
and imagery that fits the rest of the sites aesthetics.

- The most important goal of the site is for users to place an order for a surfboard manufactured to their exact requirements.

- This site is mainly aimed at users who already partake in surfing as a hobby and have the required skill to warrent needing 
this type of high end product. Regardless of this there will be enough information to aid users who perhaps don't have as much
prior knowledge.

### Scope Plane | Trade Off

- The current features that are in the design plan and of the highest priority are;

    - Responsive navigation bar.

    - Hero image with a button placed strategically to direct the user to the most important page.

    - Following [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) grid system with the layout of the site
    being mainly in thirds.

    - Footer containing links to social media platforms.

    - A form page that contains radio buttons, drop down lists and text inputs.

- The features that are of a lower priority that may not be including in this build of the site are;

    - Closeable modal window that prompts the user to sign up for the newsletter.

    - Map included on site providing the exact location of the business.

    - A more generlised contact form option.

    - Navigation bar changing to a clickable burger icon on smaller screen sizes.

    - Navigation links enlarging when hovered over with the users cursor.

### Structure Plane

- This site will be structured using lots of imagery and short informative paragraphs. 

- The layout will mainly be in thirds or in half on larger screen sizes to not overload the user visually 
and to keep the functionality at optimum.

- In order to direct the user to the most important areas of the website buttons and imagery for these
will be contained with the hero image that will be seen first.

- To ensure the users experience when completing the form for ordering is smooth, this page will contain
minimal information and imagery to not distract the user.

## Design
### Colour Scheme

- The main colours used will be monochrome and very simplistic, using ivory, charcoal and black.

- Reasoning behind these choices are that they add a sense of luxury to the brand and don't pull the attention 
away from the imagery and purpose of the site.

### Typography

- There will be two similar font types used throughout the website. The 'Comfortaa' font for the headings 
with a Sans Serif fallback font if for any reason the font isn't imported correctly or a certain browser doesn't support it. 
The font primarily used for paragraph text will be 'Inconsolata' with the same fallback font of  Sans Serif.
            
 - 'Comfortaa' is a clean, stylish, and aesthetically pleasing font that will tie in well with the styling of the rest of
the website. This font works well for headings therefore creating consistency without effecting the sites style.

- 'Inconsolata' is not to dissimilar from 'Comfortaa' so again it creates consistency, however, there is enough of a difference
that it breaks up text sections and overall makes the website easy to read and aesthetically pleasing.

### Imagery

- The imagery will be very important on the website, I plan to use images to convey information about the company and
products. The first thing visitors will see when the site loads will be a large jumbotron image with a call to action 
button included. The reason for this is to immediately direct the user to the key order form page.

- I also plan to use imagery on the modal that prompts visitors to sign up to the newsletter.

- One of the website pages will be a surfers stories section where I will use imagery to tell a story about previous customers, 
primarily informing the visitor about what the business creates featuring previous products. As well as, showing the design process.

- There will also be icon imagery included in the site, however, this will be minimal in order to still keep the aesthetic style
consistent.

- The imagery used will be de-saturated in colour and the main focal will be on the products and lifestyle based around these. 
The de-saturation in colour will fit in with the rest of the simple monochrome colours used throughout the rest of the website.

### Logo

- The logo for site was created using the same Sans Serif style font through an online application called 
[Hatchful](https://hatchful.shopify.com/). It follows the same greyscale color that the rest of the site is styled in 
and was designed in a clean, and simple way that aesthetically works well but alse follows visual hierarchy.

## Features

- Responsive on all devices and screen sizes.

- Call to action placed with hero image below modal window.

- Closeable modal pop up window open when website first loads.

- Simple form included in modal asking for an email address.

- Fixed navigation bar to enhance useability.

- Linked icons to social media platforms included in footer.

- Extensive form that includes radio buttons, drop down boxes, and text input.

- Small interactive feautures such as enlargement when hovering over navigation bar.

- Seperate general contact form.

- Card containers used on Surfers Stories page to display information in a visually appealing
way.
