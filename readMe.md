## User Experience (UX)
### - User Stories
####    - First Time Visitor Goals

            a. As a first time visitor, I want to gain understanding of the purpose of the site and the intentions of the
            business. Including explanative information in case of not having a strong understanding of the product.

            b. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily find the product information that I visited the site for.
            Also have an enjoyable experience aesthetically and find using the websites features simple.
            
            c. As a first time visitor, I want to look for previous products created to ensure that using this company is the
            right decision, I would expect to find these not only through social media links but also a gallery page. Also
            providing customer testimonials would enhance this.

####    - Returning Visitor Goals

            a. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to easily order a product custom to my specifications in a
            reasonably quick manor.

            b. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to find alternative ways to contact the company other than the order
            form. This is in case of needing to alter my order, or to request an update.

            c. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to find out further information about the company and brand. This
            included new products, design and background history.

####    - Frequent Visitor Goals

            a. As a frequent visitor, I want to easily be able to sign up to a newsletter so that I always find out about 
            upcoming changes/information via email.

            b. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to create an account so that my order history and details are easily 
            accessed for use in future orders.

            c. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to find further social media links to be able to follow on 
            multiple platforms.

## Design
###     - Colour Scheme

            - The main colours used will be greyscale and very simplistic, using ivory, charcoal and black.

            - Reasoning behind these choices are that they add a sense of luxury to the brand and don't pull the attention 
            away from the imagery on the site.

###     - Typography

            - There will be two similar font types used throughout the website. The 'Comfortaa' font for the logo and headings 
            with a Sans Serif fallback font if for any reason the font isn't imported correctly or a certain browser doesn't support it. 
            The font primarily used for paragraph text will be 'Inconsolata' with the same fallback font of  Sans Serif.
            
            - 'Comfortaa' is a clean, stylish, and aesthetically pleasing font that will tie in well with the styling of the rest of
            the website. This font works well for headings therefore creating consistency without effecting the sites style.

            - 'Inconsolata' is not to dissimilar from 'Comfortaa' so again it creates consistency, however, there is enough of a difference
            that it breaks up text sections and overall makes the website easy to read and aesthetically pleasing.

###     - Imagery

            - The imagery will be very important on the website, I plan to use images to convey information about the company and
            products. The first thing visitors will see when the site loads will be a large jumbotron image with a call to action 
            button included. The reason for this is to immediately direct the user to the key order form page.

            - I also plan to use imagery on the modal that prompts visitors to sign up to the newsletter.

            - One of the website pages will be a gallery section where I will use imagery to tell a story, primarily informing the visitor 
            about what the business creates featuring previous products. As well as, showing the design process.

            - There will also be icon imagery included in the site, however, this will be minimal in order to still keep the aesthetic style
            consistent.

            - The imagery used will be de-saturated in colour and the main focal will be on the products and lifestyle based around these. 
            The de-saturation in colour will fit in with the rest of the simple greyscale colours used throughout the rest of the website.
